### Things You Should Know ###

RUNNING AN EXCHANGE IS HARD.

Peatio makes it easier, but running an exchange is still harder than a blog. It's not as simple as downloading the source code and boom!!! a fancy site is ready to roll. We always prioritize security and speed over 1-click setup. We split Peatio to many components (processes) so it's flexible to deploy and scalable.

SECURITY KNOWLEDGE IS A REQUIREMENT.

Peatio cannot protect your customers when you leave your admin password 1234567, or open sensitive ports to public internet. No one can. Running an exchange is a very risky task because you're dealing with money directly. If you don't known how to make your exchange secure, hire an expert.

You must know what you're doing, there's no shortcut. Please get prepared before you continue:

* Rails knowledge
* Security knowledge
* System administration
