## Things You Should Know

**RUNNING A EXCHANGE IS HARD.**

Peatio makes it easier, but running an exchange is still harder than a blog, which you can download the source code and following the guide or even a cool installer and boom!!! a fancy site is there to profit. We always prioritize security and speed higher than 1-click setup. We split Peatio to many components (processes) so it's flexible to deploy and scalable.

**SECURITY KNOWLEDGE IS A REQUIREMENT.**

Peatio cannot protect your customers when you leave your admin password 1234567, or open sensitive ports to public internet. No one can. Running an exchange is a very risky task because you're dealing with money directly. If you don't known how to make your exchange secure, hire an expert.
