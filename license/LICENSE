                        THE AMERO
                  PUBLIC RESOURCE LICENSE                  
July/2021

This Software is a  collection  of  works  by  Contributors
worldwide whose authorization is thusly granted for use  as
a  Public  Resource,  without  charge,  to  any  individual
obtaining  a  copy  of   this   Software   and   associated
documentation files—aside from the  license  of  which  the
original  must  remain  untouched  with  the  exemption  of
appending attributions—(the "Software"),  to  deal  in  the
Software without restriction, including the rights to  use,
copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute,  utilize,  erase,
and/or sell copies  of  the  Software  with  the  following
limitations:

Anyone who contributes  code  will  be  referred  to  as  a
"Contributor" regardless of whether they are a  programmer,
developer, artist, student, professional, individual, team,
corporation, non-profit, structured  organization,  church,
government employee, or non-human (A.I.)

All contributions must be licensed under this  license  for
all work submitted; therefore, any addition  added  by  any
Contributor will automatically  become  a  Public  Resource
once accepted into this repository. It is important to note
that the code does not enter the public domain or  creative
commons.

Users "you, your, them, they, their, parties,  Contributor"
who wish to utilize  this  code  for  their  projects  must
license their  Software  under  the  same  license  without
sublicensing unless the  code  used  from  this  repository
represents less than one-fifth of your entire  project,  in
which case the derivative source  code  repository  is  not
required to extend this license to your  derivative  source
code, but conspicuous attribution  is  required,  and  this
license file must be included within  the  repository  with
the location of the source code from this  repository  used
appended to this license.

Contributors are not allowed to  mix  code  with  the  core
repository code if it utilizes  a  license  different  from
this one; except if the code is packaged by itself  and  it
operates independently from this code such  as  a  library,
protocol, generator, utility, system  Software,  framework,
driver Software, compilers, or algorithm. Anything that  is
packaged with its own license; additionally,  this  license
will not extend to folders with their own license  file  if
that code was not developed for the project specifically.

Once a Contributor submits their code, the code belongs  to
the Software—which requires attribution—and the Software is
owned by the public as a collective,  and  that  collective
cannot sell the code within this repository by  any  means,
and that collective cannot change this repository’s license
once enacted.

If  this  repository  is  forked,  this  license  and   all
contributions will remain Public Resources under  the  same
license; This license applies  to  all  contributions,  and
Contributor  credits  will  not   be   removed   from   the
repository; however, their code  may  be  excluded  at  any
time. Users may append their Public Resource Notice to this
license. 

Parties interested in using portions of the  code  in  this
repository may  do  so  but  must  properly  attribute  the
project and its Contributor. Each  section  of  code  added
from this repository must include  the  author's  name  and
email address as a comment attributing their work.

This  license  allows  code  snippets  and  sections   from
repositories that carry this license to be used within  any
type of licensed Software including closed source, provided
the amount of code used does not exceed "one-fifth" of  the
code used in Public Resource Licensed Projects; independent
packages, comments, and meaningless code do not  constitute
code; percentage of code  will  be  measured  by  character
count,  not  including  white  space,  blank   space,   and
newlines.

An unaltered copy  of  this  license  as  a  file  must  be
included in the repository where your code is located.  The
license does not apply to any other parts  of  the  project
except for the code that  was  used.  It  is  essential  to
include  the  location(s)  of  the  code  used  from   this
repository in your code appended to this  license.  If  the
project is closed source, a complete copy of  this  license
and any appended information must be  included  within  the
Software and the following attribution is  required  to  be
displayed prominently on a screen where the user  must  see
when using the Software such as a splash screen or endnote:

            Public Resource ℗ 2021 Peatio Developers
            Public Resource ℗ 2021 Amero Developers

When this Software is to be licensed or sold as  a  service
or through any sales channel, the seller, organization,  or
company will be required to expressly inform  the  customer
that the customer can perform the work on servers that  the
customers own or have  access  to,  using  the  open-source
Software repository before any sale.

Under no  circumstances  shall  extensions  or  plugins  be
developed  under  a  different  license  that  directly  or
explicitly  relies  on  this  repository's   Software.   In
addition to this violation,  any  Software  which  directly
uses this repository as the center point of their  Software
must also be  licensed  under  the  AMERO  PUBLIC  RESOURCE
LICENSE and must also release their full source code to the
public.

A  closed  source  or  any  other  licensed  Software  that
explicitly  requires   this   repository's   Software   for
operation is prohibited.

This license strictly prohibits anyone from generating  any
monetary or valuable gain from selling extra features  that
they have excluded from this source code.

Once a contribution has been accepted to a repository  with
this license, it cannot be removed as  a  Public  Resource.
The Contributor may still issue takedown  notices  if  they
suspect that code was stolen from this repository, but they
may not issue takedown notices for this repository  or  any
other repository like it. Contributors can continue to  use
their own code  submitted  in  other  repositories  without
restrictions. A contribution of the  code  found  elsewhere
shall be superseded by this license.

As  a   result   of   the   submission,   the   Contributor
automatically relinquishes most copyright authority of  the
source code contributed to this repository to license it to
the public as a  Public  Resource.  In  no  way  shall  the
repository owner, manager, or key operational  Contributors
have any inequitable rights  over  this  source  code.  The
Contributor  is  still  allowed  to  use  the   code   they
contributed to other repositories but  must  link  to  this
license. A Public Resource consists of code  snippets  from
Contributors (the public) that belong to the Software whose
source code is shared (licensed) to the public.

THE CONTRIBUTORS OF THIS PROJECT HAVE REDUCED THE COPYRIGHT
AUTHORITY OF THEIR CODE TO THIS  PROJECT  (REPOSITORY)  AND
ITS SOURCE CODE SO THAT ANYONE MAY OBTAIN  A  LICENSE  WITH
MINIMAL RESTRICTIONS. IN DOING SO,  THE  CONTRIBUTORS  HAVE

REPOSITORY) TO PERFORM ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR,  OR
CORRECTIONS TO THE SOFTWARE INCLUDED  IN  THIS  REPOSITORY.
THE  DISCLAIMER  OF  THE  WARRANTY  CONTAINED   HEREIN   IS
ESSENTIAL TO THIS LICENSE.

append any documentation here:

The MIT license has been removed  from  this  fork  due  to
dangerous   vulnerabilities,   and   liability   conflicts.

This software will be  licensed  under  the  "AMERO  PUBLIC
COMMON RESOURCE" license, or  "APCR,"  and  we  will  honor
those   who   have   contributed   to   this    repository.

ISSUE 1: LICENSE LOOPHOLE

1. Permission is hereby granted, free  of  charge,  to  any
person obtaining a copy of  this  software  and  associated
documentation files (the "Software")

Software includes documentation which includes the  license
to the repository

2.  to deal in the Software without restriction
3. including without limitation
4.  the  rights  to  use,  copy,  modify,  merge,  publish,
distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the  Software

The above gives any user full right to do  whatever  they’d
like to these repositories as it gives unlimited  abilities
by stating anyone is allowed to modify the Software without
restriction, and without limitation.  This  directly  gives
anyone an open license, thus we have  cleared  the  license
from this software and licensed it with the Public Resource
License to help improve the community of public sources  by
better   protecting   developers,   and    limiting    what
corporations    may    do    when     “borrowing”     code.

__THE  FOLLOWING  DOES  NOT   LICENSE   THIS   REPOSITORY__

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person
obtaining  a  copy  of   this   software   and   associated
documentation  files  (the  "Software"),  to  deal  in  the
Software without restriction, including without  limitation
the  rights  to  use,   copy,   modify,   merge,   publish,
distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software,
and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished  to
do   so,   subject    to    the    following    conditions:

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall
be included in all copies or substantial  portions  of  the
Software.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY  OF  ANY
KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO  THE
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE  AUTHORS
OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY  CLAIM,  DAMAGES  OR
OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT  OR
OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION  WITH  THE
SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR  OTHER  DEALINGS  IN  THE  SOFTWARE.

Due to the license allowing total and complete  control  of
source code, including documentation, it serves as a danger
to the crypto community as one could license it for private
use under their own repository or even use a  version  that
holds no  license  at  all  and  therefore,  no  waiver  of
liability.

The  legal   definition   of   documentation   specifically
includes:

	1. Amending Agreement
	2. Partnership Agreement
	3. General Contracts
	4. Building Contracts
	5. Common Law Partner Agreement
	6. Compensation Agreement
	7. Corporate Bylaws and Articles of Incorporation
	8. Construction Contract
	9. Contract Addendum
	10. Contract Amendment
	11. Consulting Agreement
	12. Employee Contract
	13. End User License Agreement
	14. Independent Contract Agreement
	15. Mortgage Agreement
	16. Non-Disclosure Agreement
	17. Purchase Agreement
	18. Sales Agreement
	19. Shareholder Agreement
	20. Subtractor Agreement
	21. Website Privacy Policy
	22. Website Terms and Conditions

Under U.S.  Law:  every  license  agreement  is  a  legally
binding  contract  between  the  licensor   and   licensee.

What about where  it  says  "...subject  to  the  following
conditions:

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall
be included..."

Great question. Since there is full and complete  authority
to modify this license—as a license is  legally  considered
documentation—and since we are without restriction, we  can
remove the  line  that  reads  "subject  to  the  following
conditions,"  save,  and  delete  the   license   entirely.

"...this software and associated documentation  files  (the
"Software")"  -  all  documentation   files   are   legally
considered the Software in this context, of which  we  have
exercised that right:

"...including without limitation the rights to...modify..."


ISSUE 2: LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

Courts will refuse to enforce  such  provisions  where  the
court found that:

	1. The provision was ambiguous or unconscionable;
	2. The parties' intentions were not clearly expressed;
	3. One party had unequal bargaining powers or a higher
	level of sophistication;
	4. There was a public policy or statute prohibiting
	the enforcement of the provision;
	5. The provision contradicted a substantial public
	interest;
	6. The liability provisions were unfair and one-sided

Unequal bargaining power exists when a party  must  ‘accept
what is offered or forego the advantages of the contractual
relation in a situation where it is necessary  for  him  to
enter into the contract to obtain something of  importance.
The singular point is that the legal system does not  allow
you to have your  cake  and  eat  it  too.  As  in,  own  a
copyright, yet have no liability.

Waivers are a matter of state law, which vary  widely,  and
have no single federal law governing them.
