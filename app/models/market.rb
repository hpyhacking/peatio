# People exchange commodities in markets. Each market focuses on certain
# commodity pair `{A, B}`. By convention, we call people exchange A for B
# *sellers* who submit *ask* orders, and people exchange B for A *buyers*
# who submit *bid* orders.
#
# ID of market is always in the form "#{B}#{A}". For example, in 'cnybtc'
# market, the commodity pair is `{btc, cny}`. Sellers sell out _btc_ for
# _cny_, buyers buy in _btc_ with _cny_. _btc_ is the `target`, while _cny_
# is the `price`.
