  # Change the native redirect uri for client apps
  # When clients register with the following redirect uri, they won't be redirected to any server and the authorization code will be displayed within the provider
  # The value can be any string. Use nil to disable this feature. When disabled, clients must provide a valid URL
  # (Similar behaviour: https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2InstalledApp#choosingredirecturi)

  # native_redirect_uri 'urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob'

  # Specify what grant flows are enabled in array of Strings. The valid
  # strings and the flows they enable are:

  # "authorization_code" => Authorization Code Grant Flow
  # "implicit"           => Implicit Grant Flow
  # "password"           => Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant Flow
  # "client_credentials" => Client Credentials Grant Flow
  #
  # If not specified, Doorkeeper enables all the four grant flows.

  # grant_flows %w(authorization_code implicit password client_credentials)

  # Under some circumstances you might want to have applications auto-approved,
  # so that the user skips the authorization step.
  # For example if dealing with trusted a application.
